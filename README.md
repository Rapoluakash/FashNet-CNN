# FashNet-CNN 👕🧠
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying Fashion MNIST images using TensorFlow 2.x

## 🧾 Overview
**FashNet-CNN** is a deep learning model designed to classify grayscale images of clothing items from the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist). It leverages a convolutional architecture with dropout regularization to achieve high accuracy on fashion image recognition tasks.

## 🧠 Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow's `Sequential` API and contains:
- 2 Convolutional Layers (64 filters, 3×3 kernel, ReLU activation)
- 2 MaxPooling Layers
- Flattening Layer
- Fully Connected Layer (128 units, ReLU)
- Dropout Layers (0.5) for regularization
- Output Layer (10 units for classification)

## 📊 Dataset
- **Dataset**: Fashion MNIST
- **Classes**: 
  - T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat
  - Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot
- **Shape**: 28×28 grayscale images
- **Size**: 60,000 training / 10,000 test samples

## 🚀 Training
- **Optimizer**: RMSprop
- **Loss**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: Configurable (typically 5–20)

## 🖼️ Visualization
- Preprocessing: Normalized pixel values (0–1)
- Plots for:
  - Sample images
  - Class labels
  - Predictions (optional)

## 📈 Results

The model achieves over **90% accuracy** on the test set with minimal tuning. Dropout layers help reduce overfitting.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

* Model checkpointing
* Hyperparameter tuning (via KerasTuner or Optuna)
* Experiment with other optimizers (Adam, SGD)
* Visualization of feature maps and confusion matrix
